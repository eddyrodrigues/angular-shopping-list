# Angular-shopping-list App

This app was part of the first part of the course (Master Angular (formerly "Angular 2") and build awesome, reactive web apps with the successor of Angular.js) from Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller

What you are going to see in that repository in terms of Angular:

- Components (Components divided by its own resposability)
- Use of Directives *ngIf, *ngForm \*ngModel
- Use of Custom Directives (Hightlight directive and set class directive to open dropdown menu with angular and not from bootstrap js - avoiding two javscripts to modify the DOM)
  - Use of @HostBinding and @HostListener
- Use of Module (app.module) where we can find all declarations
- Property Binding and two-way binding with \*ngModel
- @Input() [Property] and @Output() [Events] with Alias
- A little bit of Css
- @ViewChild() acessing the ElementRef<HTMLInputElement> to work with the nativeElement
- ReactiveFormsModule - FormGroup
